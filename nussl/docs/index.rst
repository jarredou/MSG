*nussl* (pronounced `nuzzle <http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nuzzle>`_) [#f1]_ is a flexible,
object oriented python audio source separation library created by the
`Interactive Audio Lab <http://music.cs.northwestern.edu>`_ at Northwestern University.
At its core, *nussl* provides implementations of common source separation algorithms as well as an
easy-to-use framework for prototyping and adding new algorithms. The aim of *nussl* is to create a
low barrier to entry for using popular source separation algorithms, while also allowing the user
fine tuned control of low-level parameters.
